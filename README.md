# ruby-irc-bot
A simple IRC bot for educational purposes

The code is deliberatly kept simple, in order to be easy to understand. E.g. we don't use classes, regexes or single quotes for strings and we don't omit parentheses (apart from with `puts`) and so on.

The bot will connect to `irc.libera.chat` by default. You can join the same server by going to https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#rubymonstas.
